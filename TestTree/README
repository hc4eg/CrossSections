In this directory OutTxt.cpp generates a text file which computes results of cross section and asymmetry
in certain Theta (here Theta_p = Theta_q) and Phi (relative azimuthal angle from p to q) within a Delta (Ee-Ep) range.

To use it:
1. Under /TestTree, type "cmake CMakeLists.txt", then "make -j4", it will generate OutTxt
2. Type "./OutTxt", and type Value of Theta (3 to 13 degrees )under instruction, also the percentage range (0 to 100 percent)
   of Delta (ie. Eq-Ep). (10 percent gives data from -6 MeV to 6 MeV of Delta)
3. This will generate data file with name "Xsec.run%3d.dat".

The data files will contain:
1. Number of points, value of Theta, Phi
2. Value of total cross section, symmetric part of cross section, asymmetric part of cross section, and asymmetry curve under certain delta.



Copy/ move generated data files into /DelSmall and use Plot.C will give ROOT TGraph of cross section curves and asymmetry

To use it:
1. Copy/ move data files like "Xsec.run%3d.dat" into /DelSmall
2. Type "root"
3. In ROOT, Type ".L Plot.C+"
4. In ROOT, type "AsymPlot()"
5. Follow the instruction, type the full data file name in form "Xsec.run%3d.dat"
6. Plots will be generated.
